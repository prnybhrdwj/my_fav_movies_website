# my_fav_movies_website
This website lists down some of my favorite movies. You can see the name of the movie along with the movie poster. If you click on any movie, you can see its trailer video in the browser
This is my first project on python. It was made as a part of Udacity course. 
# Parts of the code
There are 3 files used for this-
1) media.py - It has a constructor called Media, with 1 child constructor - Movie. It was created by me.
2) fresh_tomatoes.py - It contains all the HTML, CSS and JS, shared by Udacity team, that makes the webpage where all the movies are displayed, including the iframe to show trailers in webpage
3) Entertainment_Center.py - This has all the instances of movies that I wanted to list, used from the constructor created in media.py
# Guidelines to use
1) You should already have python installed on your computer to run this. This was created using Python 2.7.12 but you can use any version to run this.
2) Clone media.py, Entertainment_Center.py and fresh_tomatoes.py on your computer. Keep them in the same folder
3) Just run the Entertainment_Center.py file using IDLE shell.
4) A webpage will open up on your default web browser. It will have a list of 6 of my fav movies. You can click on any movie to view its trailer.
